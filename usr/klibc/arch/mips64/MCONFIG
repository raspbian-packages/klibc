# Normal binaries start at 0x120000000 (4608 MiB).
# * On R5 and earlier, non-PIC jumps usually use the JAL instruction
#   which requires a destination within the same 256 MiB aligned
#   region. Since we can't put ourselves below the normal load
#   address, use the very top of the 256 MiB region (minus 2 MiB).
# * On R6, non-PIC jumps may use either the JAL instruction or the
#   BALC instruction which requires a destination within Â±128 MiB. Put
#   ourselves just under 128 MiB above the executable base address.
